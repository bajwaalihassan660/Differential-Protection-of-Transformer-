# Differential-Protection-of-Transformer-
Differential Protection of Transformer Using Relays and Magnetic Contactors in Power System Protection
I implemented differential protection for a transformer using relays and magnetic contactors in a power system. This project involved designing a protection scheme to detect and isolate faults within the transformer windings. Differential relays were used to monitor the difference in currents entering and leaving the transformer, triggering magnetic contactors to disconnect the transformer in case of a fault. I configured the relays to operate based on preset current differentials, ensuring sensitive and reliable fault detection. This project enhanced my skills in protective relay coordination, transformer protection schemes, and the application of magnetic contactors in power systems.

Skills Gained:
Differential Protection Scheme Design
Relay Selection and Configuration
Magnetic Contactor Application in Power Systems
Transformer Fault Detection and Isolation
Protective Relay Coordination
Practical Experience in Power System Protection
